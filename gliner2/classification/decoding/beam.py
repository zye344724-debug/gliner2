"""Beam decoder: bounded fallback when exact search exceeds its node budget.

Crucially NOT ``joint_ie/optimizers/beam.py``, whose ``optimize`` returns a
greedy-max assignment when the beam empties (``beam.py:86-87``) - for hard
classification constraints that silently emits a *constraint-violating* answer.
Here, an empty beam means "beam could not find a feasible assignment" and we
report exactly that (the caller then falls to min_violations). We never return
a violating assignment as if it were feasible.
